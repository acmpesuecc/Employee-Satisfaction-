# Employee-Satisfaction
## Introduction
Every employee has certain views about their workplace, and this program calculates the average satisfaction that all the employees of a particular company have about their workplace

## Description
The program consists of 2 types of access,
1. The Employee - the employee will be asked to enter the rating based on 3 simple questions, and will be asked to write in a feedback about the workplace
2. The Administrator - Has control of all the employee feedbacks and can either create or delete based on their will, the admin can view the overall employee satisfaction index 

## The Program
The program uses simple data structures in C with linked lists being primarily used. 
It is Begginer friendly so feel free to make as many changes as can be made!
